# Contribute

Since SkyDocs' repositories are open-source and community-driven, we strongly rely on your input and donations to develop and grow.

The following guide will help you achieve contributions to SkyDocs' GitHub repositories.

You can contribute in 3 ways:

* ****[**Create Issues**](create-issues.md) **\[GitHub/Discord]**
* ****[**Fork and Pull**](fork-and-pull.md) **\[GitHub]**
* ****[**Donate**](donate.md)****

{% hint style="info" %}
Using GitHub is the preferred method of contribution to maintain a high level of version control and enable bug, ideas, and feedback tracking.

Alternatively, you can talk to a team member on Discord about your ideas, feedback, or material contribution. This is a more time and resource-consuming way and could lead to delayed implementations. For communication details please visit our [**Connect**](../connect.md) page.
