### Help Sections

We have broken the help topics down into sections to help you find what you're after. Below is an overview of what you'll find.

#### ⚠️ [Error Troubleshoot](error-troubleshoot.md)

The Error Troubleshoot page has a collection of errors users may run into while using our apps and services. It shows the problem with both a solution and a reason explaining why it happened in the first place.

#### ℹ️ [FAQs](faqs.md)

The FAQs page answers the common questions we get from SkyDocs users. The answers to these questions give advice, an explanation, or a link to a helpful resource.

### Direct Support
