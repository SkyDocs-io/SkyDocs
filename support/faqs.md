# FAQs

### Is SkyDocs free?

Yes. SkyDocs is a community-powered and maintained project. Everything is provided for free, though the community can donate to the team to cover our costs or say a "Thank you üññüèª". Details can be found [**here**](../contribute/donate.md).

### Where is SkyDocs available?

There are no geo-restrictions enabled. You can access our repositories from any internet enabled device thought any web browser. A dedicated mobile application is on the roadmap.

### Why do you only accept Bitcoin donations?

We want to keep everything 100% transparent. Bitcoin is fast, decentralized, and 100% transparent. Anyone can check our wallet's entire transaction history on demand. We also post all expenses we pay to keep the community up-to-date with everything. Check out our [**Donations**](../contribute/donate.md) page here for info on how to donate and to check out the [**SkyDocs Expenses**](../contribute/donate.md#skydocs-expenses).
